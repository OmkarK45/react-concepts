- Why HOOKS 
 -- Classes are a bit difficult for beginners
 -- Classes in Javascript are not real classes but a syntactical sugar over constructor function
 -- this keyword is confusing in js . 
 -- Classes require some boilerplate code.
 -- Hence react team improved functional components
 -- sfc will avoid repeated references to this keyword. Simply pass props as an argument to your function. We will use a special method call useState() from react library. This is called hooks
 -- useState() is called react Hook. It is used to hook into react state.
